## 🤖 AI Assistance Declaration
Generative AI (ChatGPT/Gemini) was used as an assistive tool for debugging and code optimization.

* **Application: During the development process, we utilized generative AI as a strategic collaborator to enhance both the technical and aesthetic aspects of our website. The AI provided critical feedback and guidance on UI/UX principles, allowing us to transition static elements into highly interactive and functional features that align with our visual standards. Furthermore, we leveraged AI for targeted debugging and code optimization, providing a necessary bridge when we encountered complex implementation gaps or persistent technical roadblocks.**
